## Startup Configuration and Project Structure
After it has been pip installed, `ritual_engine` can be used as a command line tool. Start it by typing:
```bash
ritual_engine
```
When initialized, `ritual_engine` will generate a .ritualrc file in your home directory that stores your ritual_engine settings, like your default chat model/provider, image generation model/provider, embedding model/provider, database path, etc.

On startup, `ritual_engine` comes with a set of jinxs and NPCs that are used in processing. It will generate a folder at ~/.ritual_engine/ that contains the jinxs and NPCs that are used by the shell by default if there is no `npc_team` within the current directory. Additionally, `ritual_engine` records interactions and compiled information about npcs within a local SQLite database at the path specified in the .ritualrc file. This will default to ~/ritual_engine_history.db if not specified. 

The installer will automatically add this file to your shell config so that it initialize these variables whenever a shell is activated, but if it does not do so successfully for whatever reason (i.e. if you use an alternative rc type) you can add the following to your .bashrc or .zshrc:

```bash
# Source RITUAL_ENGINE configuration
if [ -f ~/.ritualrc ]; then
    . ~/.ritualrc
fi
```

We support inference via all major providers through our litellm integration, including but not limited to: `openai`, `anthropic`, `ollama`,`gemini`, `deepseek`,  and `openai-like` APIs. The default provider must be one of `['openai','anthropic','ollama', 'gemini', 'deepseek', 'openai-like']` or other litellm compatible ones. `openai-like` is `ritual_engine`-specific in how it works but is intended forr custom servers/locally hosted ones (like those from LM Studio or Llama CPP). The model must be one available from those providers.

To use models that require API keys, create an `.env` file up in the folder where you are working or place relevant API keys as env variables in your `~/.ritualrc`. If you already have these API keys set in a `~/.bashrc` or a `~/.zshrc` or similar files, you need not additionally add them to `~/.ritualrc` or to an `.env` file, but `ritual_engine` will always check the current folder's `.env` should you want to have projects use separate api keys without manually switching them.
Here is an example of what an `.env` file might look like:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_key"
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY='your_deepseek_key'
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your_gemini_key'
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY='your_perplexity_key'
```


Individual npcs can also be set to use different models and providers by setting the `model` and `provider` keys in the npc files.

Once initialized and set up, you will find the following in your ~/.ritual_engine directory:

```bash
~/.ritual_engine/

└── images/ # images created or uploaded during conversations
└── jobs/ # scheduled jobs 
└── logs/ # logs for triggers and jobs
├── npc_team/           # Global NPCs
│   ├── jinxs/          # Global jinxs
│   └── assembly_lines/ # Workflow pipelines
└── screenshots/ # taken with the screenshot jinx or /ots macro
└── triggers/ # jobs that trigger on certain conditions
```

For cases where you wish to set up a project specific set of NPCs, jinxs, and assembly lines, add a `npc_team` directory to your project and `ritual_engine` should be able to pick up on its presence, like so:
```bash
./npc_team/            # Project-specific NPCs
├── jinxs/             # Project jinxs #example jinx next
│   └── example.jinx
└── assembly_lines/    # Project workflows
    └── example.pipe
└── models/    # Project workflows
    └── example.model
└── example1.npc        # Example NPC
└── example2.npc        # Example NPC
└── team.ctx            # Example ctx
```
