# NPCPY


## Python Examples
Integrate `ritual_engine` into your Python projects for additional flexibility. Below are a few examples of how to use the library programmatically.

### Example 1: using ritual_engine's get_llm_response

```python
from ritual_engine.llm_funcs import get_llm_response

# ollama's llama3.2
response = get_llm_response("What is the capital of France? Respond with a json object containing 'capital' as the key and the capital as the value.",
                            model='llama3.2',
                            provider='ollama',
                            format='json')
print(response)
# assistant's response is contained in the 'response' key for easier access
assistant_response = response['response']
print(assistant_response)
# access messages too
messages = response['messages']
print(messages)


#openai's gpt-4o-mini
from ritual_engine.llm_funcs import get_llm_response

response = get_llm_response("What is the capital of France? Respond with a json object containing 'capital' as the key and the capital as the value.",
                            model='gpt-4o-mini',
                            provider='openai',
                            format='json')
print(response)
# anthropic's claude haikue 3.5 latest

response = get_llm_response("What is the capital of France? Respond with a json object containing 'capital' as the key and the capital as the value.",
                            model='claude-3-5-haiku-latest',
                            provider='anthropic',
                            format='json')



response = get_llm_response("What is the capital of France? Respond with a json object containing 'capital' as the key and the capital as the value.",
                            format='json',
                            model='gemma3:4b', 
                            provider='ollama')


# with stream
response = get_llm_response("whats going on tonight?",
                            model='gpt-4o-mini',
                            provider='openai',
                            stream=True)

for chunk in response['response']:
    print(chunk)
```

### Example 2: Building a flow with check_llm_command

```python
#first let's demonstrate the capabilities of npcpy's check_llm_command
from ritual_engine.llm_funcs import check_llm_command

command = 'can you write a description of the idea of semantic degeneracy?'

response = check_llm_command(command,
                             model='gpt-4o-mini',
                             provider='openai')



# now to make the most of check_llm_command, let's add an NPC with a generic code execution jinx


from ritual_engine.npc_compiler import NPC, Jinx
from ritual_engine.llm_funcs import check_llm_command

code_execution_jinx = Jinx(
    {
        "jinx_name": "execute_python",
        "description": """Executes a code block in python.
                Final output from script MUST be stored in a variable called `output`.
                          """,
        "inputs": ["script"],
        "steps": [
            {
                "engine": " python",
                "code": """{{ script }}""",
            }
        ],
    }
)


command = """can you write a description of the idea of semantic degeneracy and save it to a file?
             After, can you take that and make various versions of it from the points of
             views of different sub-disciplines of natural lanaguage processing?
             Finally produce a synthesis of the resultant various versions and save it."
            """
npc = NPC(
    name="NLP_Master",
    primary_directive="Provide astute anlayses on topics related to NLP. Carry out relevant tasks for users to aid them in their NLP-based analyses",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    provider="openai",
    jinxs=[code_execution_jinx],
)
response = check_llm_command(
    command, model="gpt-4o-mini", provider="openai", npc=npc, stream=False
)

```



### Example 3: Creating and Using an NPC
This example shows how to create and initialize an NPC and use it to answer a question.
```python
import sqlite3
from ritual_engine.npc_compiler import NPC

# Set up database connection
db_path = '~/npcsh_history.db'
conn = sqlite3.connect(os.path.expanduser(db_path))

# Load NPC from a file
npc = NPC(
          name='Simon Bolivar',
          primary_directive='Liberate South America from the Spanish Royalists.',
          model='gpt-4o-mini',
          provider='openai',
          db_conn=conn,
          )

response = npc.get_llm_response("What is the most important territory to retain in the Andes mountains?")
print(response['response'])
```
```bash
'The most important territory to retain in the Andes mountains for the cause of liberation in South America would be the region of Quito in present-day Ecuador. This area is strategically significant due to its location and access to key trade routes. It also acts as a vital link between the northern and southern parts of the continent, influencing both military movements and the morale of the independence struggle. Retaining control over Quito would bolster efforts to unite various factions in the fight against Spanish colonial rule across the Andean states.'
```


or to stream a response, 
```python
from ritual_engine.npc_sysenv import print_and_process_stream
response = npc.get_llm_response("What is the most important territory to retain in the Andes mountains?",
                                 stream=True)
accumulated_response = print_and_process_stream(response['response'])
```

### Example 4: Orchestrating a team



```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import os
from ritual_engine.npc_compiler import NPC, Team, Jinx


# Create test data and save to CSV
def create_test_data(filepath="sales_data.csv"):
    sales_data = pd.DataFrame(
        {
            "date": pd.date_range(start="2024-01-01", periods=90),
            "revenue": np.random.normal(10000, 2000, 90),
            "customer_count": np.random.poisson(100, 90),
            "avg_ticket": np.random.normal(100, 20, 90),
            "region": np.random.choice(["North", "South", "East", "West"], 90),
            "channel": np.random.choice(["Online", "Store", "Mobile"], 90),
        }
    )

    # Add patterns to make data more realistic
    sales_data["revenue"] *= 1 + 0.3 * np.sin(
        np.pi * np.arange(90) / 30
    )  # Seasonal pattern
    sales_data.loc[sales_data["channel"] == "Mobile", "revenue"] *= 1.1  # Mobile growth
    sales_data.loc[
        sales_data["channel"] == "Online", "customer_count"
    ] *= 1.2  # Online customer growth

    sales_data.to_csv(filepath, index=False)
    return filepath, sales_data


code_execution_jinx = Jinx(
    {
        "jinx_name": "execute_code",
        "description": """Executes a Python code block with access to pandas,
